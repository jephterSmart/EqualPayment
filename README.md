# Equal Payment series

This is a terminal program that we pass in three argument to the funtion equalPayment. The arguments are:
* _amount_ - This is the present money we want to add interest on
* _interestRate_ - This is the rate by which the money grow per year.
* _years_ - This is the number of years we are expected to give the money out.

----
the ` amount ` argument is the money we are going to give to our investor every year and he is promising us to increase the money once a year by our ``` interestRate ``` for the number of ` years ` we supplied in as argument.
